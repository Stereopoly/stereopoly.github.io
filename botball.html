                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
									<p>Botball is a very advanced robotics competition between teams composed of mostly high schoolers and some middle schoolers. It is slightly below the level of FRC - First Robotics Competition, since there is no cutting of pieces allowed, but it is very similar in the software department. I started doing Botball in 6th grade, even though it is a middle school competition. I had experience in FLL so it wasn't too big of a jump. The entire environment of Botball is different. In FLL, you usually form a team with a couple friends who also are interested in robotics, but in Botball, the teams are composed of people from 6th through 12th grade. Each team has a couple of senior people who are captain of the team, and then a mix of rookies and slightly more experienced people. The senior people lead the meetings and delegate tasks to the rest of the team to do. They try to teach the less experienced as well so when the rookies are seniors, they can pass on their knowledge to the next generation of rookies.</p>   
                                    
                                    <h3>Robot Game</h3>
                                    <p>
Each year, the robot game is released around January-Feburary. The robots compete on a table which is 8' by 8'. The maximum size of the robots usually is 15' by 15' by 15'. Sometimes, there are changes. The table usually has two sides divided with PVC pipe. In the middle, there is a gap where robots can drive through. There are two parts to the competition: Seeding and Double Elimination. Each round is 2 minutes long. In seeding, your robot(s) try to score as many points as possible in the given time. There is no opponent and you can use the scoring objects on both sides of the table to score. In Double Elimination, two teams are pitted against each other on the table. They try to score as many points as possible on their side, while possibly disrupting the other team's robot. Usually, a small robot is built to quickly get to the other side and randomly drive around to hopefully hit the other robot. Some teams have even knocked other robots off the table! Double elimination is usually the most exciting part of the competition.</p>
                                    <h3>Competition</h3>
                                <p>There are two competitions per season. In April, there is a regional competition between a bunch of other teams in the nearby area. Every team advances to the championship competition is called GCER, Global Conference for Educational Robotics. There are teams from all over the world at this competition. This competition has a lot more teams than the regional competition. Each year, the location of this competition changes. It has been in Hawaii and L.A. over the past couple years.</p>
                                <h3>My Role</h3>
                                <p>I am the captain of my team I have been on the past couple years. I help the programmers and builders when they have issues, and also schedule the work that has to be done. I am also the technical lead of the team, heading up the building of the competition robots and making sure they are well built. Over the years I have done Botball, I have learned a lot about building robust systems to accomplish precise tasks.</p>
