                            <h3>4th Grade</h3>
                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>My friend and I used a Lego Mindstorms robot to develop a small solar panel that would follow the sun. We wanted to see how much more efficient solar panels could be if they followed the sun rather than just standing in a static position. We found out that a moving solar panel was able to generate 4 times more electricity than a static solar panel.</p>
                            <h4>Learned</h4>
                            <p>This was my first science fair project so that was quite a milestone for me. I learned a lot about documenting my data with graphs and writing paragraphs about what I had done. This was also one of the first group projects that I had done which spanned over 2 months.</p>
                            <br />
                            <h3>5th Grade</h3>
                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>This year me and a friend did another team project and this time it had to do with my family's electric car. We wanted to figure out whether or the battery in our Nissan Leaf could be used to power the house. During the night, the car is charged at a very low rate. During the day, when the electricity costs are high, the battery can be used to power the house.</p>
                            <h4>Learned</h4>
                            <p>This project was a very theoretical project compared to the solar panel project, so there was a lot more math and calculations involved. I learned about documenting all the calculations in Excel and writing in words what I was calculating.</p>
                            <br />
                            <h3>6th Grade</h3>
                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>In 6th grade the science fair was mandatory for everyone as it was a part of the Science class curriculum. I did this one myself rather than with someone else. For this experiment, I wanted to calculate the cost of creating your own hydropower system to power your house. There would be a large tank on the roof that would store a large amount of water. During the night when electricity was cheaper, water would be pumped up to the tank. During the day, the water would fall down because of gravity and power a generator. The generator would generate electricity for the house. Excess electricity could be sold to the grid for some money. </p>
                            <h4>Results</h4>
                            <p>The cost of pumping the water onto the roof is 15 times more expenive than the electricity returned from the water falling down and powering a generator. As well as that, there is a $3000-$4000 dollar price tag for all of the equipment. The main electricity cost for the system is the pump. If it was more efficient, the system could be more feasible and actually help you save money.</p>
                            <h4>Learned</h4>
                            <p>While doing this project I learned a lot more about doing research and logging everything you do. This project took a lot longer than the other two projects because of the depth of this project and I worked by myself on this project.</p>
