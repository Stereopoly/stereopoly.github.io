                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
									<p>I started learning Swift in 8th grade after taking an iOS 7 course using Objective-C in 7th grade. Swift has so far been very fun to learn not only because it is used to develop iPhone apps, but also the interesting compoents Swift has that other languages don't have. I have developed several iPhone applications, 5 of which are currently on the Apple App store.

                                    <h3>FBLA 2018</h3>
                                    <p>In my Junior year at Los Altos High School, I participated in the Mobile Application Development competition in FBLA. This year's task was to create an app that would allow students to check out, check in, and reserve books, and navigate the library. I worked on the app with Shawn Huang, another Junior at my high school, meeting up many times over the course of a month to work on the </p>
                                    <p>We made use of many external tools to expedite the development process. For versioning, we used Github we were both very familiar with it and liked to use GitKraken alongside. For depenency management, we used Cocoapods. This allowed us to easily integrate things like Realm for the library database and Buglife for bug reporting. In addition, we used Fabric and mainly its Crashlytics tool so that any crashes found by our beta testers could be symbolicated and analyzed easily to fix.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Make School</h3>
                                    <p>In the summer of 8th grade, I went to an 8 week long camp called Make School. It was a summer long class where we would first learn Swift, then ship an app to Apple's App Store. The camp was very selective and I had to go through quite a long admissions process to get in. There was a very long form with all sorts of questions to be filled out, and then a interview with the founder of the camp. I got in and loved it. The camp was located at 3 different locations: San Fransisco, New York City, and Sunnyvale. I went to the Sunnyvale locaiton which was hosted at the Plug and Play Tech Center. That location was amazing because the building housed over 300 startups.

The first 3 weeks of the camp I learned Swift by cloning 2 applications that were already on the app store. Then for the next 5 weeks, I worked on my own application to be submitted to the app store. The camp culminated with a Demo Day where we showed our apps to companies and investors.</p>
