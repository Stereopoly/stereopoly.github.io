                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
									<p>I started learning Swift in 8th grade after taking an iOS 7 course using Objective-C in 7th grade. Swift has so far been very fun to learn not only because it is used to develop iPhone apps, but also the interesting compoents Swift has that other languages don't have. I have developed several iPhone applications, 4 of which are currently on the Apple App store.

                                    <h3>Make School</h3>
                                    <p>In the summer of 8th grade, I went to an 8 week long camp called Make School. It was a summer long class where we would first learn Swift, then ship an app to Apple's App Store. The camp was very selective and I had to go through quite a long admissions process to get in. There was a very long form with all sorts of questions to be filled out, and then a interview with the founder of the camp. I got in and loved it. The camp was located at 3 different locations: San Fransisco, New York City, and Sunnyvale. I went to the Sunnyvale locaiton which was hosted at the Plug and Play Tech Center. That location was amazing because the building housed over 300 startups.

The first 3 weeks of the camp I learned Swift by cloning 2 applications that were already on the app store. Then for the next 5 weeks, I worked on my own application to be submitted to the app store. The camp culminated with a Demo Day where we showed our apps to companies and investors.</p>
